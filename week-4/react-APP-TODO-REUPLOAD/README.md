This projet is a simple app to create a todo list .
It has following features --

- Anyone can create a todo list 
- Anyone can see their existing todo list 
- Anyone can mark a todo as done 

For backend 
// initialize a node project
// put a package.json 

# Building a MERN Stack Todo Application with Zod

## 1] **Environment Setup**

- Install Node.js and npm on your machine.
- Set up a new React project using Vite: `npm create vite@latest`.
- Create a new Node.js project for the backend.

## 2] **Frontend Development (React)**

- Design the UI structure for your to-do app.
- Create React components for adding, displaying, and deleting todos.
- Utilize React Hooks (useState, useEffect) for managing the frontend state.
- Set up a clean and user-friendly interface for a seamless user experience.

## 3] **Backend Development (Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Zod)**

- Configure a Node.js and Express backend server.
- Integrate MongoDB for data storage.
- Implement Zod for backend data validation to ensure secure and valid inputs.
- Create API endpoints for handling todo operations like add, fetch, and delete.

## 4] **Zod Integration**

- Install Zod in your Node.js backend project using npm: `npm install zod`.
- Define schemas using Zod to validate incoming data.
- Integrate Zod validation within your API routes for robust data validation.

## 5] **Connect Frontend to Backend**

- Establish a connection between your React frontend and Node.js backend.
- Make API calls from the frontend to interact with the backend endpoints.

## 6] **Run the Application**

- Start both the React and Node.js servers.
- Open your to-do app in a browser and verify its functionality.


----STEPS----

1] discussion on node modules , dev dependencies , package.JSON , etc
2] creating node boiler plate with middleware 
  - npm install express 
3] zod validation on types.js
   - npm i zod
4] types contains all the zod inputs from the user 
5] import the validations and add them to the endpoints inside index.js
6] did some manipulation  idk
7]  now create database mongoDB
  - npm i mongoose 
8]  create mongoose schema , also url also needed 
9] integrate DB to to code 
10] building app.get endpoint
